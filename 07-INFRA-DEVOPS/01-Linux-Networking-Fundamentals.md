# Linux + Networking Fundamentals

Most infra interviews are debugging interviews.

## Linux basics to know

- processes, signals
- file descriptors
- basic resource inspection (CPU, memory)

## Networking basics to know

- DNS, TCP, TLS
- HTTP semantics and idempotency
- timeouts and retries

## Debugging checklist

1. Is the system saturated?
2. Is there a dependency issue?
3. Is there a config/rollout change?
4. Is there packet loss or DNS failure?
