# Docker (Interview Essentials)

Docker topics often appear as practical questions: packaging, isolation, and debugging.

## What you should be able to explain

- image vs container
- layers and caching
- why containers are not VMs
- common failure: missing dependencies, wrong entrypoint

## Practical checklist

- small images (multi-stage builds)
- explicit health checks
- env var configuration
