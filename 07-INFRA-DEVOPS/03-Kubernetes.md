# Kubernetes (Interview Essentials)

Kubernetes questions test operational intuition: scheduling, reliability, and debugging.

## Core primitives

- Pods, Deployments
- Services and Ingress
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- autoscaling (HPA) basics

## Common failure modes

- misconfigured probes causing crash loops
- resource limits too low/high
- networking and DNS issues

## Debugging approach

- check pod status/events
- check logs
- verify service endpoints
- isolate config changes
