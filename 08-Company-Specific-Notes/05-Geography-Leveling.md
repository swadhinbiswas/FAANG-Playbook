# Geography + Leveling Notes

## Geography

Differences show up in:

- Compensation structures (base vs equity split)
- Visa sponsorship constraints
- Hiring timelines and headcount planning
- Remote/hybrid norms

## Leveling

Most rejections in mid/senior loops are “level risk” rejections:

- Scope is too small for the target level
- System design lacks tradeoffs or operational thinking
- Behavioral lacks ownership/impact

If you’re repeatedly failing at the same stage, consider whether you should:

- downlevel for a faster entry point,
- change archetype (enterprise vs FAANG), or
- take 6–8 weeks to close one specific gap.
