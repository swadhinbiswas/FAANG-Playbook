# Unicorns / Startups Notes

This archetype includes fast-growing startups and late-stage unicorns.

## What to expect

- Higher variance in loop structure
- Practical rounds: take-homes, pair programming, architecture discussions
- More weight on ownership, speed, and ambiguity handling

## What “strong” looks like

- You can ship end-to-end without perfect inputs
- You balance speed with correctness and reliability
- You have opinions and can defend tradeoffs

## Prep emphasis

- Build 1–2 portfolio projects that resemble real product work
- Practice scoping and prioritization (“what would you do in week 1?”)
- Be ready to discuss tradeoffs: iteration speed vs long-term maintainability

## Common failure modes

- Over-theorizing; not converging to a plan
- Weak debugging and operational readiness
- No evidence you can ship
