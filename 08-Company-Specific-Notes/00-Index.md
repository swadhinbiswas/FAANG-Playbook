# Company-Specific Notes

This folder helps you adapt the same fundamentals to different company archetypes.

The goal is not to stereotype companies; it’s to anticipate differences in:

- what is “table stakes” vs “nice to have”,
- how risk is evaluated (production safety vs growth vs compliance),
- what an “excellent” signal looks like.

## Archetypes

- FAANG / Big Tech (high-signal loops; multiple rounds; strong rubric discipline)
- Unicorns / startups (take-homes, practical builds, speed, ownership)
- Enterprise software (stakeholder mgmt, correctness, long-lived systems, governance)
- Automotive / industrial (safety, validation, long product cycles, regulated constraints)
