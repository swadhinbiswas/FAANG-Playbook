# FAANG / Big Tech Notes

This archetype includes large, high-signal tech companies with standardized interview loops, calibrated rubrics, and strong emphasis on repeatable signals.

## What to expect

- Multiple technical rounds (often 2× coding + 1× system design at mid+)
- Behavioral round(s)
- Debrief/committee-style decision making is common

## What “strong” looks like

- You operate with a rubric mindset (communication, problem solving, correctness, testing)
- You can explain tradeoffs crisply
- You show reliability/operational thinking when designing systems

Concrete example of a common coding rubric (used broadly across big tech): https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-rubrics/

## Prep emphasis

- Coding reps with strict discipline (not just solving): talk, test, optimize
- System design: practice clarifying requirements and narrowing scope
- Behavioral: 8–12 STAR stories with measurable outcomes

## What often fails candidates

- Silent coding / poor communication
- No testing / brittle correctness
- System design that skips requirements and constraints
