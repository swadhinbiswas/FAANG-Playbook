# Automotive / Industrial Notes

This archetype includes OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers, industrial automation, and safety/regulatory heavy environments.

## What to expect

- Longer product cycles and more cross-functional constraints
- Strong emphasis on validation, reliability, and safety mindset
- Hybrid stacks: embedded + cloud + data pipelines

## What “strong” looks like

- You can explain how you validate correctness (tests, fault injection, monitoring)
- You can work within strict constraints (process, compliance, supply chain)
- You think in failure modes and mitigations

## Prep emphasis

- Show evidence you can build _robust_ systems (not just prototypes)
- Prepare stories about debugging hard issues and building safety rails
- For data/ML roles: highlight monitoring and data quality

## Common failure modes

- Treating reliability as an afterthought
- Vague answers about validation and incident handling
