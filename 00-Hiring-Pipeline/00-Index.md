# Hiring Pipeline (End-to-End)

This folder is a practical walkthrough of how hiring typically works for software/data/ML/infra roles, and what to optimize for at each stage.

If you already know your target lane, jump to [02-Role-Roadmaps/00-Index.md](../02-Role-Roadmaps/00-Index.md).

## What gets evaluated (high level)

Across most “high-signal” companies, your interviews are not graded on vibes; they are graded on _signals_ and _risk reduction_:

- Can you solve problems clearly and correctly?
- Can you communicate tradeoffs and reasoning?
- Can you build/operate real systems (reliability, security, cost)?
- Will you be effective with ambiguous requirements and imperfect information?

For a concrete rubric commonly used across big tech coding interviews, see Tech Interview Handbook’s rubric overview: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-rubrics/

## Recommended order

1. ATS + shortlisting (resume, referrals, targeting)
2. Recruiter screen (scope alignment, compensation, process)
3. Online assessment / quiz (if used)
4. Phone screen(s)
5. Onsite/virtual loop (coding, system design, role-specific, behavioral)
6. Debrief / hiring committee
7. Offer, negotiation, and closing
