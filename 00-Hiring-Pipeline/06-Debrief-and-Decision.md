# Debrief / Hiring Committee / Decision

After the loop, the company consolidates evidence. You generally don’t see this step, but you can _optimize for it_.

This doc’s core idea: **optimize for the write-up.** Most debriefs are based on the written feedback. If your interviewers can easily write “hire” feedback, you win.

## What happens (typical)

- Interviewers submit feedback (often structured)
- A debrief/hiring committee calibrates signals and risk
- The recruiter communicates outcome and next steps

Different companies name this differently (debrief, hiring committee, HC, calibration), but the purpose is consistent: reduce variance and decide if the evidence clears the hiring bar.

## How your interview becomes feedback

Interviewers typically have to answer questions like:

- Did the candidate communicate clearly?
- Did they solve the problem correctly?
- Did they show good judgment and tradeoffs?
- For senior: did they show leadership/ownership?

If your process is crisp (clarify → plan → implement → test), feedback becomes easier.

## How to make your feedback easier to write

Interviewers are busy. The easier you make it to write “hire” feedback, the more likely you are to pass.

- Be explicit about tradeoffs.
- Verify correctness (tests, invariants, edge cases).
- Communicate clearly.
- Show ownership and sound judgment.

Add “sound bites” the interviewer can reuse:

- “Candidate asked strong clarifying questions and stated assumptions.”
- “Candidate validated correctness with edge cases and explained complexity.”
- “Candidate presented tradeoffs and justified the chosen design.”

Tech Interview Handbook notes that interviewers often see feedback from your other rounds and that mixed results trigger discussion and sometimes extra rounds: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-rubrics/

## Mixed signals: what tends to happen

Mixed loops are common. Typical outcomes:

- Additional round to resolve uncertainty
- Downlevel to reduce risk
- Reject (if key signals are missing)

What causes “mixed signals” most often:

- Strong coding but weak communication
- Great design ideas but poor requirements discipline
- Good behavioral but shallow technical depth (or vice versa)

## What you can (and cannot) influence after the loop

You generally cannot change the evidence after the fact, but you can:

- Follow up promptly with scheduling/logistics.
- Provide additional info if the recruiter asks (e.g., work authorization timelines).
- Stay calm and professional; recruiters remember high-friction candidates.

## What you can do after the loop

- Send a short thank-you note to your recruiter.
- If you bombed a round, don’t spiral: focus on the next step.
- If you get rejected, ask for high-level areas to improve.

If you get a “maybe” outcome:

- Expect either a follow-up round or a different-level interview.
- Treat it as normal; it’s often about resolving uncertainty.
