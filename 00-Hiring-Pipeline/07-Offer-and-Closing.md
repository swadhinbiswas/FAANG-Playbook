# Offer, Negotiation, and Closing

An offer is the start of a negotiation, not the end of the process.

Your leverage and strategy depend heavily on company archetype, your alternatives, and your timeline.

## What to do when you get the offer

- Get the full package details in writing.
- Ask about level and leveling rationale.
- Ask about team matching (if applicable).
- Ask for the decision deadline.

Also:

- Ask what parts are negotiable (many companies won’t say directly, but you can infer).
- Confirm if there are refreshers, relocation, and what the vesting schedule is.

## What to negotiate

Depends on company archetype, but typically:

- Base salary
- Equity (grant size; refreshers)
- Signing bonus
- Start date / relocation

Sometimes negotiable (depending on company):

- Title (rare)
- Level (sometimes via re-leveling)
- Remote/hybrid exceptions (varies widely)
- Education budget / equipment (more common in smaller companies)

## Archetype differences (how offers behave)

- **FAANG / Big Tech:** compensation is often more structured; biggest levers are level, equity, sign-on, and competing offers.
- **Unicorns / startups:** equity terms and strike price matter; risk-adjust your view of equity; cash may be tighter.
- **Enterprise:** base and bonus may dominate; equity may be smaller; stability/role scope may be the real “value.”
- **Automotive/industrial:** compensation bands can be rigid; negotiate role scope, level, relocation, flexibility.

## How to negotiate effectively

- Anchor with competing offers (best leverage).
- Frame as wanting to join, but needing the package to work.
- Be specific and polite.

Simple negotiation script:

> I’m excited about the role and I want to make this work. Based on my current compensation and the other processes I’m in, I’m targeting a total package closer to X. Is there flexibility on base/sign-on/equity to close that gap?

## Common mistakes

- Negotiating without understanding the full package.
- Revealing your minimum too early.
- Asking for everything at once without prioritizing.
- Treating negotiation as adversarial.
