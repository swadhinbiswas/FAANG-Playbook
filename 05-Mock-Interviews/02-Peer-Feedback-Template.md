# Mock Interview Feedback

**Interviewer:** [Your name]
**Candidate:** [Their name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Interview Type:** [Coding / System Design / Behavioral]
**Duration:** [Minutes]

---

## **Overall Impression (1-2 sentences)**

[Quick gut reaction. Example: "Strong communication and systematic approach. Struggled with edge cases."]

---

## **Strengths (What Went Well)**

### 1. [Dimension]

**What I observed:** [Specific example. NOT "You were good at coding"; instead: "You asked about input constraints before starting, which showed discipline."]

**Impact:** [Why this matters. Example: "This prevented you from making wrong assumptions."]

### 2. [Dimension]

**What I observed:** [Example]
**Impact:** [Why it mattered]

### 3. [Dimension]

**What I observed:** [Example]
**Impact:** [Why it mattered]

---

## **Areas for Improvement (What Didn't Go As Well)**

### 1. [Dimension] — PRIORITY 1

**What I observed:** [Specific example. NOT "You had bugs"; instead: "You tested your solution against the provided examples but didn't test edge cases like empty input or duplicates."]

**Why it hurt:** [Business impact. Example: "An edge case bug would likely be caught by the interviewer, and you'd lose points."]

**How to improve:** [Concrete next step. Example: "Always add 2–3 edge case tests before declaring your solution done."]

### 2. [Dimension] — PRIORITY 2

**What I observed:** [Example]
**Why it hurt:** [Impact]
**How to improve:** [Next step]

## **Specific Moments**

### Moment 1: [Where things went well or poorly]

**What happened:** [Narrate what you saw]
**Why I flag this:** [What it signals about interview readiness]
**Suggestion:** [How to handle it next time]

### Moment 2: [Another key moment]

**What happened:** [Narrate]
**Why I flag this:** [Signal]
**Suggestion:** [How to handle it]

## **Questions for the Candidate**

[Reflect together]:

- What did you think went well?
- Where did you feel stuck?
- What would you do differently?
- What's one thing you'll practice before the next mock?

## **Scoring (for your own tracking)**

| Dimension       | Score (1–5) | Notes        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Communication   | —           | [Brief note] |
| Problem Solving | —           | [Brief note] |
| Correctness     | —           | [Brief note] |
| Optimization    | —           | [Brief note] |

**Overall:** [1–5]
**Recommendation:** [Ready for real interviews / Needs X more weeks / Focus on Y]

## **Resources to Share**

Based on your feedback, here are resources to help:

- [Link to relevant playbook or practice site]
- [Link to similar problem set]
```

## **Tips for Giving Good Feedback**

### **Be Specific**

❌ "Your communication was weak."
✅ "You coded for 8 minutes before explaining your approach. By minute 3, the interviewer was confused about your strategy."

### **Balance Strengths & Growth**

- Start with 2–3 genuine strengths
- Then 1–2 priority improvements
- End with actionable next steps

### **Avoid Demotivating Language**

❌ "You're not ready for Google."
✅ "You have strong fundamentals. Focus on X for 2 more weeks, then you'll be solid."

### **Include Examples**

❌ "You should test more."
✅ "When you tested against [example], you caught a bug. Do that for every solution."

### **Mention Impact**

❌ "You didn't explain complexity."
✅ "You didn't explain complexity, so the interviewer couldn't tell if you understand Big-O. That's a signal they care about."

## **Using This as a Candidate**

When you ask for feedback, provide:

1. **Your self-assessment** ("I thought I did OK on communication but struggled with edge cases")
2. **What you're working on** ("I'm practicing better test case design")
3. **One specific question** ("Did I ask enough clarifying questions?")

This focuses feedback on what matters most to you.
