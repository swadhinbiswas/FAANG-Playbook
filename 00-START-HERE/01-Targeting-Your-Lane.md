# Targeting Your Lane (Role × Level × Company)

If you try to prepare for “everything”, you end up prepared for nothing.

Define your lane using three axes:

## 1) Role

- **SWE (generalist):** coding + fundamentals + some design.
- **Backend:** APIs, storage, distributed systems, reliability.
- **MLE:** modeling + data + production ML engineering.
- **DE:** data modeling, pipelines, orchestration, quality, cost.
- **DS:** experimentation, causal thinking, metrics, storytelling.
- **DevOps / SRE:** operability, incident response, automation, systems.
- **MLOps:** ML platforms, deployment, monitoring, reliability of ML systems.

## 2) Level

Levels differ mostly in **scope** and **judgment**.

- **Junior/Entry:** correctness + learning + basic collaboration.
- **Mid:** ownership of components, good debugging, shipping reliably.
- **Senior:** ambiguity handling, system-level thinking, influence.
- **Staff+ (where applicable):** multi-team scope, strategy, long-term risk management.

## 3) Company archetype

### FAANG / high-growth

- You’ll be evaluated on communication under ambiguity, speed of iteration, and scale tradeoffs.
- System design tends to probe: capacity planning, cache/queue patterns, failure handling.

### Enterprise software

- Expect deeper questions on maintainability, integration, migration, and reliability.
- “How do you evolve this safely?” matters as much as “how do you build it?”.

### Automotive / industrial

- Risk and safety mindset matters; verification culture is common.
- Expect emphasis on reliability, requirements clarity, and disciplined engineering.

## Lane definition template

Write this down before you start.

- Target roles:
- Target level:
- Target company archetypes:
- Primary geography/time zone:
- Interview language:
- Primary tech stack (language + cloud):
- Dealbreakers (on-call, relocation, remote, domain):

## What to do if you’re not sure

Pick a “default lane” that maximizes optionality:

- SWE/Backend at mid-level
- strong coding + foundational system design
- basic cloud + observability
- 6 strong behavioral stories

That lane transfers well into MLE/DE/DevOps once fundamentals are strong.
