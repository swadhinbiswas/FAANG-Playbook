## **Red Flags (Adjust Plan if You See These)**

- ⚠️ Week 4: Scoring 1–2 on rubric → Spend Weeks 5–6 on fundamentals reps before mocking
- ⚠️ Week 8: Can't finish problems in 45 min → Add week; do more easy/medium problems
- ⚠️ Week 8: System design blank; no framework → Redo Week 6; practice more
- ⚠️ Week 10: No recruiter calls → Improve resume; consider cold outreach; adjust targeting
