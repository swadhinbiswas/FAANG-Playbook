**Checkpoint:** By Week 16, you should score 4.5–5 on rubric across all dimensions.

---

## **PHASE 3: APPLICATION & INTERVIEW (Weeks 17–24)**

**Mindset:** Shift from prep to execution. Handle real rejections and refine.
**Time commitment:** 12–15 hours/week (less study, more interviews)

### **Week 17–18: Targeting + Resume**

| Day     | Activity                                                                                            | Output                           |

### **Week 19–20: Early Interviews**

**Assume recruiter calls this week.**

| Activity        | Frequency                       | Notes                                     |

**Expected:** 1–2 phone screens; maybe 1 rejection (normal; move on).

**Weekly:** Apply to another 3–5 companies.

---

### **Week 21–22: Onsite Loops**

**1–3 onsites scheduled.**

| Daily Activity  | Time                       |

| Behavioral      | Record yourself; 1 per day | Smoothness            |
| **Real Onsite** | 1–2                        | Actual interview days |

**After each loop:** Debrief; what went well/poorly; iterate.

**Weekly:** Still apply to new companies; expand net.

---

| Negotiation      | [Use playbook](../../08-CAREER/04-Offer-Negotiation.md) |
| Decision         | Final offer accepted                                             |

## **Daily Routine (Mid-Level)**

**Time budget: 15 hours/week = ~2 hours/day average**

- **Block 1 (60 min):** Coding problem (30 min) + reflection (30 min)
- **Block 2 (60 min):** System design OR behavioral OR reading
- **3rd block (optional, weekends):** Full mock (90 min) OR deep dive on weak area

**Flexibility:** Adjust around your day job. If busy week, do 8–10 hours. If light week, do 20 hours.

---

## **Resources**

- **Hard coding:** LeetCode Hard + company tags
- **System design:** [Template](../../04-System-Design-Library/00-System-Design-Template.md) + [System Design Template](../../04-SYSTEM-DESIGN-LIBRARY/00-System-Design-Template.md) + company blogs
- **Behavioral:** [Playbook](../../03-INTERVIEWS/06-Behavioral-Interview-Playbook.md) + leadership stories
- **Mock interviews:** Interviewing.io (paid) + peer mocks (free)

---

## **Red Flags (Adjust Plan if You See These)**

- ⚠️ Week 8: Can't design complex system from scratch → Slow down; read more theory; do simpler designs first
- ⚠️ Week 12: Behavioral stories feel generic → Add more specific metrics; emphasize decisions you made
- ⚠️ Week 18: No recruiter calls after 8 applications → Revise resume or cold outreach; consider referrals
- ⚠️ Week 20: Failing phone screens → Increase coding reps; focus on communication

---

**You've got this. 24 weeks to a mid-level or senior offer.** 🚀
