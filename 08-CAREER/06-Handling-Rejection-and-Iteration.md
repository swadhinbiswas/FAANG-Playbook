# Handling Rejection and Iteration

Rejection is often variance, not a verdict. The key is to extract signal and iterate.

## Post-interview debrief

- Which round likely failed (coding/design/behavioral)?
- Was it knowledge, execution, or communication?
- What is the smallest drill that would prevent it?

## A 2-week improvement cycle

Week 1

- fix the top failure mode with focused reps

Week 2

- run a mock loop and re-score

## Keep a “wins log”

Track improvements (e.g., fewer bugs, better structure). This reduces burnout and keeps progress measurable.
