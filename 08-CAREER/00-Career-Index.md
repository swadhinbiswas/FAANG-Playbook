# Career Index

Job prep is a pipeline:

1. targeting and positioning
2. application throughput
3. interview performance
4. offer negotiation

This folder covers the non-technical pieces that routinely gate strong engineers.

## Where to start

- If you have no interviews: [08-CAREER/01-Resume-LinkedIn-GitHub.md](01-Resume-LinkedIn-GitHub.md)
- If you’re getting screens but failing: [03-INTERVIEWS](../03-INTERVIEWS)
- If you have offers: [08-CAREER/04-Offer-Negotiation.md](04-Offer-Negotiation.md)

## Industry differences

- **FAANG/high-growth:** highly structured loops; signals are consistent across teams.
- **Enterprise:** role scope can vary widely; hiring may emphasize domain.
- **Automotive/industrial:** hiring often values safety, reliability, long-term ownership.
