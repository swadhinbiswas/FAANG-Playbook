# Resume, LinkedIn, GitHub (Recruiter Pass)

Your resume is a throughput tool. It should make it easy for a recruiter and hiring manager to say “this person fits”.

## Resume principles

- one screen = one story
- lead with impact and ownership
- numbers beat adjectives

### Bullet formula

"Did X by doing Y, resulting in Z" (with constraints/tradeoffs when relevant)

Example:

- Reduced p95 latency by 35% by adding caching + query optimization, improving checkout completion rate.

## LinkedIn

- headline: target role + credibility
- about: 5–7 lines, specific strengths
- featured: 2–3 strong projects or talks

## GitHub

Focus on 1–2 repos that show:

- readable code
- tests
- docs
- real operational thinking (monitoring, deployment notes)

Avoid a graveyard of half-finished repos.
