# Applications and Networking

Most candidates under-invest in pipeline management.

## The pipeline model

- applications → recruiter screens → technical screens → onsite loops → offers

If applications aren’t turning into screens, fix positioning and targeting.

## Networking that works

- ask for 15 minutes to understand the role/team
- be specific: why this role, why you fit
- follow up with a concise thank-you and resume

## Tracking

Use a simple spreadsheet:

- company, role, level
- referral status
- dates per stage
- notes and follow-ups
