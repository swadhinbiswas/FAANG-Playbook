# Interview Prep Calendar (Sustainable)

Most plans fail because they’re too intense to sustain.

## 60–90 minutes/day plan

Mon: coding timed + postmortem
Tue: coding pattern drill
Wed: system design mini drill
Thu: coding timed + redo mistakes
Fri: behavioral story practice
Sat: role-specific (ML/SQL/infra)
Sun: rest or mock loop

## Rules

- Every session ends with a postmortem.
- Fix the top 3 recurring failures first.
- Redo failed problems after 48–72 hours.
