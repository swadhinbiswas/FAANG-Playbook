# DevOps / SRE Roadmap

DevOps/SRE interviews evaluate whether you can keep systems healthy under change: automation, reliability, and incident leadership.

## Core competencies

- Linux + networking fundamentals
- containers and Kubernetes basics
- observability (metrics/logs/traces)
- CI/CD, safe rollouts, IaC
- incident response and postmortems

## 10-week plan

Weeks 1–2: Systems fundamentals

- networking + Linux debugging drills

Weeks 3–5: Containers + Kubernetes

- understand core primitives and failure modes

Weeks 6–7: CI/CD + deployment safety

- blue/green, canary, feature flags

Weeks 8–10: Incidents and reliability

- practice incident scenarios and communication

## Interview failure modes

- tool trivia without fundamentals
- no mental model for debugging
- ignoring SLOs, saturation, and feedback loops

## Archetype adjustments

- **FAANG/high-growth:** large fleets and standardized SRE practices.
- **Enterprise:** heterogeneous systems, compliance, slower change windows.
- **Automotive/industrial:** safety and long-lived systems; higher emphasis on risk control.
