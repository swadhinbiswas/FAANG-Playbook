# Data Scientist Roadmap

DS interviews often test whether you can make decisions with data under ambiguity.

## What DS loops commonly include

- metrics and experiment design
- SQL / analysis
- product sense / case studies
- sometimes modeling
- storytelling and stakeholder influence

## Core competencies

### 1) Metrics and experiments

- define success metrics and guardrails
- power/variance intuition
- A/B testing pitfalls

### 2) Causal reasoning intuition

- confounding, selection bias
- when correlation is enough vs not

### 3) Communication

- explain results clearly
- tie analysis to business decision

## 10-week plan

Weeks 1–2: SQL + analysis

- 3–4 timed SQL drills/week
- practice writing “one-page” conclusions

Weeks 3–6: Experimentation

- 1 case/week: metric definition + experiment plan + pitfalls

Weeks 7–8: Product sense

- practice turning vague goals into measurable plans

Weeks 9–10: Mock loop

- case study + SQL + behavioral

## Failure modes

- metric confusion (optimizing a proxy that harms long-term goals)
- p-hacking / post-hoc stories
- unclear narrative and recommendations

## Archetype adjustments

- **FAANG/high-growth:** large-scale experimentation cultures; speed and rigor.
- **Enterprise:** domain and stakeholder management may matter more.
- **Automotive/industrial:** safety/regulatory context can constrain experimentation; offline evaluation may dominate.
