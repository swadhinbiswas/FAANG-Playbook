# Data Quality

Quality is not a dashboard; it is a set of checks and ownership.

## Dimensions to monitor

- completeness
- freshness
- accuracy
- consistency

## Practical playbook

- define contracts per dataset
- add automated checks at ingestion and transformation
- alert on violations
- document owners and SLAs
