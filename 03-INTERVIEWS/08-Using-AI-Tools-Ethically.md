# Using AI Tools Ethically (2025–2026)

Many companies are evolving their stance on AI-assisted development. Your safest strategy is to be transparent and to follow the interview’s rules.

## Principles

- Follow the explicit policy for the interview.
- If unclear, ask the recruiter for rules before the interview.
- Never paste proprietary company details into tools.

## How to use AI tools well (when allowed)

- Use them for: boilerplate, syntax recall, edge case brainstorming, test ideas.
- Avoid: copying full solutions you can’t explain.

## What interviewers are watching

- Do you understand the solution and tradeoffs?
- Can you debug when the suggested code is wrong?
- Do you maintain ownership of decisions?

## Failure modes

- using a tool as a crutch without understanding
- producing code you can’t reason about
- violating interview rules
