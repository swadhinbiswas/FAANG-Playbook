# Recruiter Screen Playbook

Recruiter screens are not “small talk”. They decide whether you enter the technical funnel.

## What the recruiter is trying to learn

- Are you credible for the level?
- Is your experience aligned with the role?
- Can the company close you (comp, location, timing)?
- Are there obvious risks (communication, mismatch, unrealistic expectations)?

## Your 90-second pitch

Structure:

1. Who you are (role + years + domain)
2. What you shipped (2–3 highlights)
3. What you want next (target role + scope)
4. Why this company (1–2 concrete reasons)

## Questions you should ask

- What level is this role hiring at?
- What is the interview loop and timeline?
- What does success look like in the first 3–6 months?
- Team match process (before or after onsite)?
- Remote/hybrid expectations and location constraints?
- On-call expectations (if relevant)?

## Common failure modes

- Rambling history with no “so what”
- No clear target role/level
- Over-selling a niche skill for a generalist role
- Avoiding compensation discussion entirely (you can defer, but don’t dodge)

## Company archetype notes

- **FAANG/high-growth:** usually structured level bands and calibrated loops.
- **Enterprise:** role scope varies; clarify team and expectations early.
- **Automotive/industrial:** clarify domain constraints (safety/regulatory, onsite needs).
