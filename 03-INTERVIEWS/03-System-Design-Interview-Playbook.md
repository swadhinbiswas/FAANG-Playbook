# System Design Interview Playbook

System design interviews test your ability to design systems under ambiguity, justify tradeoffs, and communicate clearly.

## The only structure you need

Use the template in [04-SYSTEM-DESIGN-LIBRARY/00-System-Design-Template.md](../04-SYSTEM-DESIGN-LIBRARY/00-System-Design-Template.md).

## What interviewers expect (by level)

- **Mid:** a coherent architecture + basic scaling + failure handling.
- **Senior:** capacity planning + tradeoffs + operability + migrations.
- **Staff+:** multi-system tradeoffs, org constraints, long-term risk management.

## Common ways candidates fail

- No requirements: architecture doesn’t match the problem.
- No numbers: can’t justify capacity.
- No failure plan: ignores partial failure.
- Buzzwords over data flows.

## How to practice

- Do 1 prompt/week end-to-end (60–90 min).
- Do 2 “mini drills” (15 min) on one topic (cache, queue, storage).
