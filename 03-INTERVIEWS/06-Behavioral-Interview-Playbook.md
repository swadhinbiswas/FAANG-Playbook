# Behavioral Interview Playbook

Behavioral rounds are where strong engineers lose offers: not because of bad people skills, but because their stories don’t show judgment.

## The scoring model (what they infer)

- ownership and accountability
- conflict handling
- judgment under ambiguity
- communication and influence
- learning and growth

## A story structure that works

Use a modified STAR:

1. Context (one paragraph)
2. Goal (what success meant)
3. Constraints (time, people, risk)
4. Actions (what _you_ did; decision criteria)
5. Results (numbers, impact)
6. Reflection (what you’d do differently)

## Build a story bank (6–8 stories)

- a failure and what you learned
- a conflict / disagreement
- a time you led without authority
- a deep technical dive
- a high-impact delivery
- a time you improved reliability or quality

## Common failure modes

- generic stories with no specifics
- blaming others
- no reflection or learning

## Company archetype notes

- **FAANG/high-growth:** structured rubrics; crisp stories with metrics help.
- **Enterprise:** cross-functional influence and change management matter.
- **Automotive/industrial:** risk control, verification mindset, reliability culture resonate.
