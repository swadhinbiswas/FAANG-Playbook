# Take-Home and Project Interviews

Take-homes often measure what whiteboard interviews miss: code quality, architecture, testing, and communication.

## The scoring rubric (usually)

- correctness
- clarity and maintainability
- tests and edge cases
- reasonable architecture and tradeoffs
- documentation (how to run + decisions)

## How to respond (high leverage)

Before you start:

- confirm time expectations and submission format
- clarify ambiguous requirements
- ask about evaluation criteria

While building:

- keep the scope small and solid
- write tests for the “core” path
- add minimal observability/logging

Delivery:

- include a short README: setup, run, test, decisions, tradeoffs, next steps

## Common failure modes

- too much scope, unfinished core
- no tests
- no error handling
- unclear instructions to run

## If you’re time-constrained

Prioritize in this order:

1. correctness
2. clean structure
3. tests
4. docs
5. extras
