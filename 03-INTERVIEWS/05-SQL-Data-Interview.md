# SQL / Data Interview Playbook

SQL interviews are not about memorizing syntax; they’re about correctness and reasoning under time.

## The process

1. Clarify table schemas and grain
2. Identify joins and cardinality
3. Write the simplest correct query
4. Validate with a small example
5. Optimize only if asked

## High-frequency topics

- joins and deduping
- window functions
- cohort retention
- funnels
- sessionization
- slowly changing dimensions

## Failure modes

- wrong grain assumptions
- accidental row multiplication
- filtering in WHERE vs HAVING incorrectly

## Practice plan

- 3 timed SQL sessions/week
- keep a log of mistakes by category
