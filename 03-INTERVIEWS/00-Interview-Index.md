## The weekly cadence that works

If you only have 60–90 minutes/day:

- 3 days: coding reps
- 1 day: system design rep
- 1 day: behavioral rep
- 1 day: role-specific (ML/SQL/infra)
- 1 day: rest or catch-up

## Post-mortem template

After each interview practice:

- What went well?
- What broke (exact moment)?
- Root cause (knowledge vs execution vs communication)?
- Fix rule (a sentence you’ll follow next time)
- One follow-up drill to prevent recurrence
